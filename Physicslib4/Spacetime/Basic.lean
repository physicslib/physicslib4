# Spacetime

This file formalises the notion of a *spacetime* used in the AQFT-in-Lean
blueprint, section 10.2.

## Main definitions

* `Physicslib4.LorentzianAt`: the pointwise "Lorentzian" condition on a
  symmetric bilinear form on a real four-dimensional vector space, asserting
  the existence of a basis with respect to which the Gram matrix is the
  diagonal matrix `diag(-1, 1, 1, 1)`.
* `Physicslib4.Spacetime`: a real, four-dimensional, connected, smooth,
  Hausdorff manifold `M` together with a globally defined smooth,
  non-degenerate, symmetric, Lorentzian `(0, 2)` tensor field `g`.
  This corresponds to the blueprint label `def:spacetime`.

## Modelling notes

Mathlib (at `v4.31.0-rc1`) does not provide a packaged "Lorentzian manifold"
or "pseudo-Riemannian metric" type. The closest thing — `PseudoRiemannianMetric`
— lives in the downstream `PhysLean` library, which is not a dependency of
this project. We therefore unbundle the definition into Mathlib primitives:

* the underlying manifold is presented as a `Type*` `M` equipped with a
  `TopologicalSpace`, `T2Space` (Hausdorff), `ConnectedSpace`, `ChartedSpace`
  with model space `ℝ⁴`, and `IsManifold I ∞ M` (smoothness `C^∞`) where
  `I` is the chosen model with corners;
* the metric `g` is a family of continuous bilinear forms
  `TₓM →L[ℝ] TₓM →L[ℝ] ℝ`, packaged together with symmetry, non-degeneracy,
  smoothness in charts, and the Lorentzian condition at every point.

The "smoothness" of `g` is encoded via the standard idiom used by
`PseudoRiemannianMetric`: smoothness of the coordinate-expression in any
extended chart, applied to two arbitrary constant vectors in the model
space `ℝ⁴`. The four-dimensionality of `M` is captured by the choice of
model space `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 4)`.

The Lorentzian condition is captured by `LorentzianAt`: existence of a basis
`b` of the tangent space such that `g (b i) (b j)` equals
`diag(-1, 1, 1, 1) i j` (i.e. `-1` on the `0` index of the diagonal, `1` on
the other three diagonal entries, and `0` off-diagonal).

The structure carries `sorry`-free *statements*; the structure itself is a
plain `structure` definition and contains no proof obligations beyond those
carried by its fields.

A symmetric bilinear form `g` on a real four-dimensional vector space `V` is
*Lorentzian* if there exists a basis `b : Basis (Fin 4) ℝ V` of `V` such that
`g (b i) (b j) = lorentzSignature i j` for every `i j : Fin 4`.

This matches the blueprint condition that there is a basis relative to which
`g` is `diag(-1, 1, 1, 1)` (i.e. zero off-diagonal and `-1, 1, 1, 1` on the
diagonal).

/--
A *spacetime*, in the sense of the AQFT-in-Lean blueprint (section 10.2,
`def:spacetime`), is a real, four-dimensional, connected, smooth, Hausdorff
manifold `M` equipped with a globally defined smooth tensor field `g` of type
`(0,2)` which is non-degenerate and Lorentzian.

The underlying manifold data is bundled as the carrier type `Carrier` together
with topological and smooth-manifold typeclass instances (Hausdorff,
connected, `C^∞` `ChartedSpace` modelled on `SpacetimeModel = ℝ⁴`).

The metric `g` is encoded as a family of continuous bilinear forms
`val : ∀ x, TₓM →L[ℝ] TₓM →L[ℝ] ℝ`, with the following pointwise conditions:

* `symm`: each `val x` is symmetric;
* `nondegenerate`: each `val x` is non-degenerate;
* `lorentzian`: each `val x` is Lorentzian;
* `smooth_in_charts`: `g` varies smoothly in any local chart, expressed by
  the smoothness of
  `y ↦ val (e.symm y) (mfderiv I I e.symm y v) (mfderiv I I e.symm y w)`
  on the chart target, for any constant vectors `v, w` in the model space.

The non-degeneracy is stated as: if `g x v w = 0` for every `w`, then `v = 0`.
