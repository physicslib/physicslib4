# Spacetimes with a Levi-Civita connection

This file bundles a `Spacetime` together with a **Levi-Civita connection**: a
covariant derivative on the tangent bundle that is *forced* to be torsion-free
and compatible with the metric `g`.

## Design

The connection is bundled in the richer structure `SpacetimeWithLeviCivita`
rather than as a field of `Spacetime` itself. This is deliberate:

* it keeps `Spacetime` as pure geometric data (a manifold with a metric), so a
  spacetime need not come equipped with a connection;
* the connection here is **not free data**: the two proof fields force it to be
  torsion-free and metric-compatible, and since the metric `g` is
  non-degenerate such a connection is *unique*. Hence `connection` is
  determined by the metric and cannot contradict it — the concern that motivated
  the constrained design.

## Main definitions

* `Physicslib4.SpacetimeWithLeviCivita`: a spacetime with its Levi-Civita
  connection (a bundled torsion-free, metric-compatible covariant derivative).
* `Physicslib4.SpacetimeWithLeviCivita.standardMinkowski`: standard Minkowski
  spacetime with its flat Levi-Civita connection.

A `Spacetime` together with its **Levi-Civita connection**: a bundled covariant
derivative `connection` on the tangent bundle, constrained by the two proof
fields to be torsion-free and compatible with the metric `g`. Because `g` is
non-degenerate, a torsion-free metric-compatible connection is unique, so
`connection` is *determined* by the metric — it cannot contradict it.

The connection lives on this richer structure rather than on `Spacetime` so that
a bare `Spacetime` remains pure geometric data; only spacetimes whose
Levi-Civita connection has been formalised carry a `SpacetimeWithLeviCivita`.

A smooth path `μ` is a **geodesic** of the Levi-Civita connection `∇` if it is
*auto-parallel*, i.e. `∇_{μ'} μ' = 0` along `μ`.

Mathlib provides a covariant derivative only on *global* sections of the tangent
bundle (`M.connection : (∀ x, TₓM) → (∀ x, TₓM →L TₓM)`), not a derivative of a
vector field *along a curve*. We therefore phrase auto-parallelism by asking for
a global vector field `V` that restricts to the velocity `μ.tangent` along `μ`
and whose covariant derivative in the velocity direction vanishes on `μ`:
`(∇_{V} V)(μ s) = M.connection V (μ s) (V (μ s)) = 0`. Because `(∇_X σ) x`
depends only on `X x` and the germ of `σ` at `x`, this value is the genuine
covariant acceleration `∇_{μ'} μ'` and is independent of the chosen extension
`V`.

This is a genuine condition (contrast the placeholder
`Physicslib4.Spacetime.IsGeodesic := True`), now available for any spacetime
carrying a Levi-Civita connection.
