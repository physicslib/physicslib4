# Extending a `*`-homomorphism from a dense `*`-subalgebra

This file proves the analytic core needed to lift fiberwise actions to a
quasilocal C*-algebra: a *uniformly continuous* `*`-homomorphism defined on a
*dense* `*`-subalgebra `S` of a C*-algebra `A`, valued in a (complete)
C*-algebra `B`, extends to a `*`-homomorphism on all of `A`.

## Main results

* `Physicslib4.exists_starAlgHom_extend_of_dense`: existence of the extension
  `F : A →⋆ₐ[ℂ] B` agreeing with `f` on `S`.

The construction uses the uniform-space extension of a uniformly continuous map
to a complete codomain (`uniformContinuous_uniformly_extend`); all algebraic
structure (`+`, `*`, `1`, `0`, `ℂ`-scaling, `star`) is transported to the
extension by continuity and agreement on the dense subalgebra.
