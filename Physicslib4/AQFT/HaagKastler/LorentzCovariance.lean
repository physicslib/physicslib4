# Axiom 5: Lorentz Covariance

This file formalises the blueprint declaration
`def:lorentz-covariance` (Axiom 5 of the "sharpened" Haag-Kastler
axioms, section 9.3 of the AQFT-in-Lean blueprint):

> The inhomogeneous Lorentz group `𝓛` (more precisely, its identity
> component; see section 7.1 of the blueprint) acts on the
> assignment `B ↦ 𝔘(B)`. For every `L ∈ 𝓛`, there is a
> `*`-isomorphism `αL B : 𝔘(B) ≃⋆ₐ[ℂ] 𝔘(L·B)` such that the action
> commutes with isotony, in the sense that for every inclusion
> `B₁ ⊆ B₂` of basis sets the obvious diagram of inclusion arrows
> and `αL`-arrows commutes.

## Main definitions

* `Physicslib4.AQFT.HaagKastler.InhomogeneousLorentzGroup`: an
  opaque placeholder for the identity component of the
  inhomogeneous Lorentz group acting on Minkowski spacetime.
  Mathlib (at `v4.31.0-rc1`) does not provide a packaged
  `LorentzGroup` type (the `PhysLean` library does, but is not a
  dependency of this project), so we leave both the group and its
  action on `StandardMinkowskiSpacetime.Carrier` as `sorry`-bearing
  declarations.

* `Physicslib4.AQFT.HaagKastler.LorentzCovariance`: a `Prop`-valued
  predicate on a `LocalNet` asserting Axiom 5.

## Modelling notes

* The Lorentz-action data is given as: a group `InhomogeneousLorentzGroup`,
  a `MulAction` of that group on `StandardMinkowskiSpacetime.Carrier`,
  and, for each pair `(L, B)`, a `*`-algebra equivalence
  `αL B : U.algebra B ≃⋆ₐ[ℂ] U.algebra (L • B)`.

* "Commutes with isotony" is encoded by the commutativity of, for
  every `B₁ ⊆ B₂` (basis sets) and every `L`, the square formed by
  the isotony arrow `𝔘(B₁) ↪ 𝔘(B₂)` and the action arrows
  `𝔘(B₁) ≃ 𝔘(L·B₁)` and `𝔘(B₂) ≃ 𝔘(L·B₂)`. Because the isotony
  arrows are existentially quantified (see `Isotony`), we quantify
  over them: the predicate asks that *some* choice of isotony
  arrows makes the action equivariant.

* The Lorentz group itself is left as an opaque `Type` with a
  `Group` instance produced by `sorry`, to be replaced by the
  genuine identity component of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group
  once Mathlib (or a future blueprint section) provides one.

/-- A placeholder for the identity component of the inhomogeneous
Lorentz group, acting on Minkowski spacetime.

Mathlib v4.31.0-rc1 does not provide a `LorentzGroup` type. The
genuine construction lives in `PhysLean`, which is not a dependency
of this project. Downstream work should replace this opaque type by
the genuine identity component (see section 7.1 of the
blueprint). -/

the carrier of standard Minkowski spacetime. -/

**Axiom 5 (Lorentz Covariance).** A local net `U` is *Lorentz
covariant* if the inhomogeneous Lorentz group acts on the assignment
`B ↦ U.algebra B` and the action *commutes with isotony*.

Concretely, there exist:

* for every group element `L : InhomogeneousLorentzGroup` and every
  Alexandrov-basis set `B`, a `*`-algebra equivalence
  `α L B : U.algebra B ≃⋆ₐ[ℂ] U.algebra (L • B)`;
* for every inclusion `B₁ ⊆ B₂` of basis sets, a choice of
  isotony-witness unital `*`-monomorphism
  `ι B₁ B₂ : U.algebra B₁ →⋆ₐ[ℂ] U.algebra B₂`;

such that, for every `L`, every inclusion `B₁ ⊆ B₂`, and every
element `a : U.algebra B₁`, the action of `L` commutes with the
isotony inclusion:
`α L B₂ (ι B₁ B₂ a) = ι' (L • B₁) (L • B₂) (α L B₁ a)`,
where `ι'` is the isotony-witness arrow for `L • B₁ ⊆ L • B₂`
(which holds because `L • _` preserves set inclusions).
