# Axiom 1: Local Algebras

This file formalises the blueprint declaration `def:local-algebras`
(Axiom 1 of the "sharpened" Haag-Kastler axioms, section 9.3 of the
AQFT-in-Lean blueprint):

> An assignment from the Alexandrov-basis sets `𝐁` of Minkowski
> spacetime to (abstract, unital) C*-algebras `𝔘(𝐁)`, with
> `𝔘(∅) = ℂ · 1`.

## Main definitions

* `Physicslib4.AQFT.HaagKastler.LocalNet`: a `structure` bundling
  the *data* of Axiom 1: for every Alexandrov-basis set `𝐁` of
  Minkowski spacetime (together with the empty set), a carrier type
  `algebra B` and a `CStarAlgebra` instance on it, plus the
  normalisation condition that the algebra assigned to `∅` is
  (isomorphic to) `ℂ`.

## Modelling notes

* The blueprint regions `𝐁` are *non-empty* Alexandrov-basis sets,
  plus the convention `𝔘(∅) = ℂ · 1` for normalisation. We package
  this by indexing the net over arbitrary subsets `B : Set
  MinkowskiSpacetime.Carrier`, with the data only "meaningful" for
  `B ∈ Spacetime.alexandrovBasis _ _` or `B = ∅`. The Lean shape
  thus stores the assignment as a function `Set ... → Type*`
  carrying a `CStarAlgebra` instance.

* The Alexandrov-basis condition is left as a separate predicate
  `IsAlexandrovBasisSet`; downstream axioms (Isotony, Local
  Commutativity, ...) quantify only over basis sets.

* The "𝔘(∅) = ℂ" condition is encoded by a distinguished
  `StarAlgEquiv` between the fiber over `∅` and `ℂ`. We use
  `sorry`-placeholders where the unification of the `CStarAlgebra`
  instance is non-trivial; the *statement* is faithful.

/-- An *Alexandrov-basis set* of Minkowski spacetime: a subset of
`StandardMinkowskiSpacetime.Carrier` of the form `I⁺(p) ∩ I⁻(q)`
for some points `p, q`. We index over the underlying carrier of
`StandardMinkowskiSpacetime` (which is defeq to
`MinkowskiSpacetime.Carrier`) so that the Alexandrov-basis predicate
and the completely-spacelike predicate (used in Axiom 3) talk about
the same `Set`. -/

**Axiom 1 (Local Algebras).** The *data* of a Haag-Kastler local
net: an assignment, for every subset `B` of Minkowski spacetime
(thought of as an Alexandrov-basis set, with the empty set covering
the normalisation `𝔘(∅) = ℂ · 1`), of a unital C*-algebra `algebra
B`.

The "𝔘(∅) = ℂ" normalisation is captured by the field
`emptyEquivComplex` exhibiting a `StarAlgEquiv` between
`algebra ∅` and `ℂ`.

**Unitality.** In `Mathlib v4.31.0-rc1`, `CStarAlgebra` is *defined* as
the class of *unital* (complex) C\*-algebras: it extends `NormedRing`
(which extends `Ring`, so we get `(1 : algebra B)` for free) plus
`StarRing`, `CStarRing`, `NormedAlgebra ℂ _`, etc. The non-unital
version is the separately-named `NonUnitalCStarAlgebra` class.
Consequently `(1 : U.algebra B)` is available for every `B`, and
every `StarAlgHom ℂ (U.algebra B₁) (U.algebra B₂)` automatically
preserves `1` (via its `AlgHom` parent). The blueprint's "unital
\*-monomorphism" language in downstream axioms (Isotony, Lorentz
Covariance, ...) is therefore honoured by the present `LocalNet`
structure without an extra `One`/`NormedAlgebra` bundle. -/
