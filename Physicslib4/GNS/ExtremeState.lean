# Pure states and extreme points of the state space

A state `ω` on a unital C*-algebra `A` is **pure** (`Physicslib4.GNS.IsPure`) when
every positive functional `ψ` dominated by `ω` is a scalar multiple of `ω`. The
convex-geometric counterpart is that `ω` is an **extreme point** of the (convex)
state space: it is not a nontrivial convex combination of two distinct states.

This file proves the equivalence

`IsPure ω ↔ ω.IsExtremePoint`,

a classical characterization of purity. The analytic crux is the identity

`‖φ‖ = (φ 1).re`

for a positive linear functional `φ` on a unital C*-algebra
(`norm_eq_re_apply_one_of_positive`), obtained from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
for positive functionals together with the C*-norm identity `‖star b * b‖ = ‖b‖²`.
It is the bridge that lets us normalize positive functionals into states and back.

* `‖ψ‖ = (ψ 1).re` recovers the normalization `ω 1 = 1` for states
  (`State.apply_one`), pins the convex coefficients in the forward direction, and
  rescales the two pieces `ψ` and `ω - ψ` into states in the backward direction.

/-- **Norm of a positive functional.** For a positive linear functional `φ` on a
unital C*-algebra, `‖φ‖ = (φ 1).re`. The reverse bound `(φ 1).re ≤ ‖φ‖` is
immediate from `‖1‖ = 1`; the forward bound uses Cauchy-Schwarz with the first
slot equal to `1`, namely `‖φ b‖² ≤ (φ 1).re · (φ (b* b)).re ≤ (φ 1).re · ‖φ‖ · ‖b‖²`,
