# The null space of a state on a unital C*-algebra

This file formalises the statements of lemmas `lmm:lmm1` and `lmm:lmm2` from
section 10.1 of the AQFT-in-Lean blueprint.

Given a state `ω` on a unital C*-algebra `A`, the *null space* of `ω` is the
set
  `N(ω) := { n ∈ A : ω (n* n) = 0 }`,
and the *orthogonal set* is
  `N₁(ω) := { n ∈ A : ∀ b, ω (b* n) = 0 }`.

## Main statements

* `Physicslib4.GNS.nullSet`: the set `N(ω)`.
* `Physicslib4.GNS.orthSet`: the set `N₁(ω)`.
* `Physicslib4.GNS.lmm1`: `nullSet ω = orthSet ω` (blueprint `lmm:lmm1`).
* `Physicslib4.GNS.nullSubmodule`: the null space packaged as a
  `Submodule ℂ A` (carrier equal to `nullSet ω`), giving the
  linear-subspace content of `lmm:lmm2`.
* `Physicslib4.GNS.lmm2`: `nullSet ω` underlies a closed `Submodule ℂ A`
  (blueprint `lmm:lmm2`). The primary entry point is `lmm2`; the helper
  `nullSubmodule_isClosed` records closedness separately for convenience.

The *null set* of a state `ω` on a unital C*-algebra `A`:

The *orthogonal set* of a state `ω` on a unital C*-algebra `A`:

/--
Inside the proofs of `lmm1`/`lmm2`, we package `ω` as a positive linear map
using the canonical spectral order on the C*-algebra `A`. This allows
re-using the GNS / pre-inner-product-space infrastructure in Mathlib.

**Equality of the null set and the orthogonal set** (`lmm:lmm1`).

Let `ω` be a state over a unital C*-algebra `A`. Then
`nullSet ω = orthSet ω`, i.e.
`{ n : ω (n* n) = 0 } = { n : ∀ b, ω (b* n) = 0 }`.

The linear-subspace content of `lmm:lmm2`: the carrier equals `nullSet ω`,
and `nullSet ω` is closed under addition and under scalar multiplication
by complex numbers, and contains `0`.

The underlying set of `nullSubmodule ω` is closed in `A`.

/--
**The null space is a closed linear subspace** (`lmm:lmm2`, primary entry point).

Let `ω` be a state over a unital C*-algebra `A`. Then there exists a
`Submodule ℂ A` whose underlying set is `nullSet ω` and which is closed in
the topology of `A`. Concretely, `nullSubmodule ω` witnesses the
existential.
